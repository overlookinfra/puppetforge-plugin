	<p>A newline separated list of glob patterns that will be matched against paths relative to the source directory.</p>
	<p>Files with a name that matches any of the patterns in this list will be excluded from the validation.</p>
	<p>The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				The <em>*</em> character matches zero or more characters of a name component without crossing directory boundaries.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				The <em>**</em> characters matches zero or more characters crossing directory boundaries.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				The <em>?</em> character matches exactly one character of a name component.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				The backslash character (<em>\</em>) is used to escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The
				expression <em>\\</em> matches a single backslash and "\{" matches a left brace for example.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				The <em>[ ]</em> characters are a <i>bracket expression</i> that match a single character of a name component out of a set of
				characters. For example, <em>[abc]</em> matches <em>"a"</em>, <em>"b"</em>, or <em>"c"</em>. The hyphen (<em>-</em>)
				may be used to specify a range so <em>[a-z]</em> specifies a range that matches from <em>"a"</em> to <em>"z"</em>
				(inclusive). These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches <em>"a"</em>, <em>"b"</em>, <em>"c"</em>, <em>"e"</em>, <em>"f"</em>
				or <em>"g"</em>. If the character after the <em>[</em> is a <em>!</em> then it is used for negation so <em>[!a-c]</em>
				matches any character except <em>"a"</em>, <em>"b"</em>, or <em>"c"</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within a bracket expression the <em>*</em>, <em>?</em> and <em>\</em> characters match themselves. The (<em>-</em>)
				character matches itself if it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character after the <em>!</em> if negating.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Leading period <em>&#47;</em> dot characters in file name are treated as regular characters in match operations. For example, the <em>"*"</em>
				glob pattern matches file name <em>".login"</em>.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
